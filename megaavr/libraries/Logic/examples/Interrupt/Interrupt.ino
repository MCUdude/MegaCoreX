|                                                                       |
| A library for interfacing with the megaAVR Configurable Custom Logic. |
| Developed in 2019 by MCUdude.                                         |
| https://github.com/MCUdude/                                           |
|                                                                       |
| In this example we use the configurable logic peripherals the the     |
| megaAVR to create a 3-input NOR gate using logic block 2 on PORT D.   |
| We will use input on PD0, PD1 and PD2. Instead of having an output    |
| pin the logic block will instead trigger an interrupt that runs a     |
| user defined function.                                                |
|                                                                       |
|                                     3-input NOR truth table:          |
| If we look at the truth table       |PD2|PD1|PD0| Y |                 |
| to the right, we can see that       |---|---|---|---|                 |
| all binary values for Y can         | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |                 |
| be represented as 00000001.         | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |                 |
| If we convert this 8-bit            | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |                 |
| binary number into hex, we          | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |                 |
| get 0x01.                           | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |                 |
|                                     | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |                 |
| In this example the output is       | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |                 |
| true if all inputs are low.         | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |                 |
|                                                                       |
