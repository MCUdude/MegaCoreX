|                                                                       |
| A library for interfacing with the megaAVR Configurable Custom Logic. |
| Developed in 2019 by MCUdude.                                         |
| https://github.com/MCUdude/                                           |
|                                                                       |
| In this example we use the configurable logic peripherals the the     |
| megaAVR to create a 2-input AND gate using logic block 0 on PORT A.   |
| The example is pretty straight forward, but the truth table value may |
| be a little difficult to understand at first glance.                  |
| We will only use PA1 and PA2 as inputs. when the first input is       |
| disabled it will always be read as 0.                                 |
| Here's how 0x08 turns out to be the correct value to create a 2-input |
| NAND gate:                                                            |
|                                     2-input AND truth table:          |
| If we look at the truth table       |PA0|PA1|PA2| Y |                 |
| to the right, we can see that       |---|---|---|---|                 |
| all binary values for Y can         | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |                 |
| be represented as 00001000.         | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |                 |
| If we convert this 8-bit            | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |                 |
| binary number into hex, we          | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |                 |
| get 0x08.                           | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | PA0 is always 0 |
|                                     | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | PA0 is always 0 |
| In this example the output pin      | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | PA0 is always 0 |
| will only go high if the two        | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | PA0 is always 0 |
| input pins are high.                                                  |
