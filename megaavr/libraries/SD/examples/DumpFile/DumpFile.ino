/*
  SD card file dump

  This example shows how to read a file from the SD card using the
  SD library and send it over the serial port.
  Pin numbers reflect the default SPI pins for Uno and Nano models.

  The circuit:
   SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** SDO - pin 11
 ** SDI - pin 12
 ** CLK - pin 13
 ** CS - depends on your SD card shield or module.
 		Pin 10 used here for consistency with other Arduino examples
   (for MKRZero SD: SDCARD_SS_PIN)

  // open the file. note that only one file can be open at a time,
  // so you have to close this one before opening another.
